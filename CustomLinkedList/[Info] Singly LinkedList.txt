Collection 1:
- Advantage:
1. can grow and shrink at runtime.
2. efficient on memory utilization. Only use what we need.
3. easy implementation.
4. insert and delete are easy operations.
- Disadvantage:
1. traversing the linked list is not efficient.
2. no random access to a given item.
3. required more memory than array, needs to store pointer too.

Collection 2:
- Advantage:
1. dynamic data structure. (allocates needed memory while running)
2. insertion and deletion of nodes is easy. O(1)
3. no/low memory waste.
- Disadvantage:
1. greater memory usage. (additional pointer)
2. no random access of elements. (no index [i])
3. accessing/searching elements is more time consuming. O(n)

Uses?:
1. implement Stacks/Queues.
2. GPS Navigation.
3. music playlist.
